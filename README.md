# Adolescent-Depression

This project is to find the Dissociative Disorder symptoms and episodes in the age 18 to 21 and the first onset of symptom trajectories. The data for this task is collected by Prof. Dan Klein using questionnaires, interviews, laboratory experiments etc.

The focus of this project is to find the variables which perform best in predicting the above and the laboratory measures which perform better. 

Descriptive_Statistics.ipynb has the code to find the descriptive statistics below:
  1. Division of variables(continuous and categorical)
  2. Mean and Standard Deviation for continuous variables
  3. Count per category of categorical varibles
  4. Inter-correlation between continuous variables
  
In order to run the ipynb file, use Anaconda and a jyupter notebook. Running the cells in the file generates excel sheets for the above statistics in the current directory.
